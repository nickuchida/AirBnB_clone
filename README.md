Write a README.md:


description of the project
description of the command interpreter:


how to start it
how to use it
examples


You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. For format, reference Dockerâ€™s AUTHORS page
Also, we strongly encourage you to use branches and pull requests on Github - it will help you as team to organize your work



### [1. Be PEP8 compliant!](./tests/)
* Write beautiful code that passes the PEP8 checks.


### [2. Unittests](./models/base_model.py)
* All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests


### [3. BaseModel](./models/base_model.py)
* Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:


### [4. Create BaseModel from dictionary](./models/engine/file_storage.py)
* Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).


### [5. Store first object](./console.py)
* Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation:


### [6. Console 0.0.1](./console.py)
* Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:


### [7. Console 0.1](./models/user.py)
* Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands:


### [8. First User](./models/state.py)
* Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel:


### [9. More classes!](./console.py)
